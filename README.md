# Prediction and Evaluation of Coronavirus and Human Protein-Protein Interactions

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a study that predicts and evaluates protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between coronaviruses and human proteins using five different computational methods. The project aims to provide a comprehensive comparison and evaluation of these methods to better understand the interactions between coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV-2, and humans, which is crucial for mitigating the coronavirus pandemic.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Comparison**: Assessment of five prevalent computational methods.
- **Unbiased Datasets**: Evaluation using C1, C2h, C2v, and C3 test sets.
- **Unified Model**: Integration of five methodologies for predicting PPIs.
- **High-Confidence PPI Network**: Establishment of a network consisting of 18,012 interactions between 3,843 human proteins and 129 coronavirus proteins.
- **Validation**: Validation of predictions through current knowledge framework and network analysis.
